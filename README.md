## [Project 1: Performance Analysis of Bike Frames in Professional Cycling Races](https://github.com/enzopimentel/Bike-Frames-in-Grand-Tour-Wins)

This project looks at the three Grand Tours in professional cycling from 2020 â€“ 2023 to see which bicycle frame is the best, and what it means for pro riders, potential sponsors/investors, and for regular consumers. 

* Race results data was scraped from [firstcylcing.com](https://firstcycling.com/).
* Teams bikes and equipment was scraped from various websites, primarily official brand websites and bike article websites.
* The data was cleaned with the pandas and datetime libraries, and excel.
* The dashboards and visuals were made with Power Bi.

## [Project 2: An Exploratory Data Analysis on K-pop Groups, Members, and Industry](https://github.com/enzopimentel/K-pop-Industry-Exploratory-Analysis)

This project analyzes data about idols, their groups, company, nationality, among others to have an understanding of the K-pop Industry from the 1990s to current times. This analysis will cover gender splits, prominent companies, member retention rates, height, age, and nationality predominance, group longevity by debut year, and other facets of the industry.

* The datasets were created in Visual Studio Code, using the Jupyter Notebook extension
* The data used were from Kaggle and scraped from dbkpop.com
* The Python libraries used were BeautifulSoup and Pandas.
* The data was analyzed and visualized in Power BI.

## [Project 3: Correlation Analysis of University Rankings, GDP, and Population](https://github.com/enzopimentel/Uni-Rankin_GDP_World-Population_Correlation)

This project analyzes the correlation between 2020 university rankings from different ranking bodies, the GDP of the countries of the universities, as well as the 2020 World Population of the countries as well. This analysis uses Spearman Correlation to answer the question _"Does GDP and country population have an effect on the university's ranking?"_.

* The datasets were from Kaggle
* Visual Studio Code (with Jupyter Notebook extension) was used to process and visualize the data
* The Python packages Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used

## [Project 4: Bank Marketing Analysis with Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/enzopimentel/bank-marketing-ML)

This project analyzies data from the UCI repository on a dataset about a bank's marketing campaign for a term deposit subscrition. This analysis will look into the demographic of the customers, such as age, occupation, marital status, educational achievement, among others; the aspects of the marketing efforts, such as call duration, number of calls per client, and the success rate of the marketing. Machine models were used to try to predict subscription success rate based on the features of the dataset.

* The datasets were from the UCI ML repository [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)
* Different ML models (Logisitc Regression, Gradient Boost, SVM, XGBoost, KNN, Naive Bayes, Neural Network from sklearn, Nueral Network from Tensorflow) were employed to assess which was the best fitting model
* The Python libraries used were Numpy and Pandas, Sklearn, Tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn, imblearn.
